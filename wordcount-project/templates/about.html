<h1>About</h1>
<br>
<p>This is a basic website I created from a Nick Walters Udemy Course.<br>
  The idea is that you post some text in the text box and it will return the word count, and how many times words have been used in  that text.<br>
  This was created using django, python and html.</p>

  <a href="{% url 'home' %}">Back to Word Count </a>
